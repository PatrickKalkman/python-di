Python’s increasing popularity has led to the development of larger and more complex projects. This growth has sparked developers’ interest in high-level software design patterns, like those prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD).

Yet, implementing these patterns in Python can be challenging.

This hands-on series aims to provide Python developers with practical examples. The focus is on proven architectural design patterns to manage application complexity.

This repository contains examples that go with this [Medium article](https://medium.com/better-programming/python-persistence-perfected-67efc33f472d) that describes using the repository and unit of work patterns with Python.
